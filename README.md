Clone of the code available at: https://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/Apps-and-software/top-cut-code-paper

To run the file open Matlab and type `topcut`. To modify the boundary and load conditions or optimization settings (volume fraction, number of elements, filter size etc) modify the `init_cantilever` file or create a new init-file with a similar structure.
